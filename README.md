# napari plugin of Deep Ensample U-net for Image Segmentation 
This is the repository for developing a napari plugin for the deep ensamble U-net model presented in [Kaminski et al. (2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PLSdnHPx-W6) and used in [Monta単ana-Rosell et al. (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820149/).

In this repository, you will find the python translation of the R code used in [Monta単ana-Rosell et al. (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820149/) located in the *Monta単ana-Rosell translation* folder. You will also find the plugin in its current state.

Currently, the U-net implemented in the plugin is [SachinSamuel01's simple-cell-segmentation](https://github.com/SachinSamuel01/simple-cell-segmentation/tree/master) - moving forward, the deep ensamble U-net will be implemented instead. The post-analysis from [Monta単ana-Rosell et al. (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820149/) will also be included as part of the plugin.
