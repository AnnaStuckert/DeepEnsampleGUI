# napari GUI of Deep Ensample U-net for Image Segmentation 
This is the repository for developing a napari GUI for the deep ensamble U-net model presented in [Kaminski et al. (2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PLSdnHPx-W6) and used in [Montañana-Rosell et al. (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820149/).

In this repository, you will find the python translation of the R code used in [Montañana-Rosell et al. (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820149/) located in the *Montañana-Rosell translation* folder.

Moving forward, the napari GUI will also be available here along with a thorough tutorial of how to use it.

Feel free to reach out with questions or if you want to collaborate on the project.
